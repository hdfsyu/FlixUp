# FlixUp!
play the official game [here](https://hdfsyu.itch.io/flixup)
# building and running
to build the game download lime flixel and haxeflixel and openfl and in the root of the project type `lime test windows -debug` or on macOS its mac instead of windows and on linux its linux u should see the built binaries in export/osname/bin if u compiled for macos or linux u should see "neko" as it will build on the neko platform. Also if ur smarter than me u can compile for ios and android (just remove all the refrences to FlxG.keys and FlxG.mouse like anything with keys and mouse u should remove) to compile on android type: `lime test android -debug` or on ios `lime test ios -debug` I would love to compile for ios but I dont have a mac yet AND you can compile for flash `lime test flash -debug` WARNING: RUNNING WITH FLASH IS NOT STABLE. AND WILL NEVER BE ALSO U CANNOT USE THE MOUSE IN FLASH SINCE I AM A STUPID DUMB DUMB
